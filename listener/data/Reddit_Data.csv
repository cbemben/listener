 family mormon have never tried explain them they still stare puzzled from time time like some kind strange creature nonetheless they have come admire for the patience calmness equanimity acceptance and compassion have developed all the things buddhism teaches ,1
buddhism has very much lot compatible with christianity especially considering that sin and suffering are almost the same thing suffering caused wanting things shouldn want going about getting things the wrong way christian this would mean wanting things that don coincide with god will and wanting things that coincide but without the aid jesus buddhism could also seen proof god all mighty will and omnipotence certainly christians are lucky have one such christ there side but what about everyone else well many christians believe god grace salvation and buddhism god way showing grace upon others would also help study the things jesus said and see how buddha has made similar claims such rich man getting into heaven joke basically advocating that should rid ourselves material possessions fact distinctly remembered jesus making someone cry because that someone asked what achieve salvation and jesus replied with live like buddhist very very roughly translated also point out that buddha rarely spoke anything about god theory personally because knew well enough leave that jesus and mohamed who came later just remember conflict difference opinion but education can fun involving and enlightening easier teach something than prove right like intelligent design ,1
seriously don say thing first all they won get its too complex explain normal people anyway and they are dogmatic then doesn matter what you say see mechante post and for any reason you decide later life move from buddhism and that doesn suit you identity though you still get keep all the wisdom then your family will treat you like you went through weird hippy phase for while there didncha and you never hear the end pro tip don put one these your wall jpg ,-1
what you have learned yours and only yours what you want teach different focus the goal not the wrapping paper buddhism can passed others without word about the buddha ,0
for your own benefit you may want read living buddha living christ thich nhat hanh you might find any subsequent discussions with your loved ones easier you are able articulate some the parallels that exist between buddhism and christianity don surprised they react negatively for having lost you treat them with compassion and deserved understanding although they may indeed display signs being hurt your new path properly sharing with them way that may alleviate their fear something they may perceive wrong the very least alien their beliefs may help allowing them the long run accept although not necessarily agree with your decision regardless where they end you have make your own way ,1

was teens when discovered zen meditation was then undiagnosed bpd being homeschooled and just gotten 56k modem with web connection where came across link zen meditation tried for couple weeks and the change was palpable felt the most profound sense peace ever felt grades immediately started going had more energy started martial arts just huge positive change all around parents asked something was wrong fundie parents when anything changes this was where naiveté kicked foolishly told them been trying meditation and really calmed down thought they happy that found something that helped but never forget what happened next mother affected this mockingly calm breathy voice she said you can pretend calm and happy all you want but without jesus you never content was that moment that any belief had christian faith all vanished completely realized that she had probably never been happy ever have never felt profoundly sorry for someone did for her that moment,1

there are two varieties christians dogmatic that dwell words and conservative that take heart the spirit the teachings hate oversimplify things but helps this understanding you are discussing with dogmatic religious people who live the letter the law will uphill battle wish you luck you are discussing with moderates exchange idea should come fairly easily comparing contrasting also discussing parallel teachings presented differently wouldn out the ordinary they may give you relevant spiritual advice even though you are not believer their religion ,-1
dont worry about trying explain yourself just meditate regularly and try hard you can more aware everything else will follow coming from someone who has been throught his situation welcome pms ,1
 recently told family that buddhist live the bible belt this whole ordeal involved leaving the baptist church and everything been pretty rough but those who really care about have been open and accepting they seen the good has created life and relationships with others fact there are handful christians who have lovely conversations with and that truly respect someone else suggested living buddha living christ great one read about the important dialogue between buddhists and christians also welcome you message ,1
 unto others you would have them unto you would good start ,1
first understand that you are not anyway control how they will react always find that any subject better understood first learning the vocabulary explain what the word buddha means most people believe buddhists praise worship and follow guy named buddha christians due jesus let them know that one could both buddhist and christian with conflict the teachings and the messages jesus are indeed buddhist philosophy jesus became enlightened buddha and realized that had become annointed being christ then continue with your practice and let them work out their own issues that advice all the best ,1
 recently heard similar question where person asked they should introduce meditation his loved ones who had challenges coping with problems life the answer from the lama was quite interesting instead giving people advice one should focus his practice that way others will see the change and maybe even ask about personally think better keep yourself even though you must really excited about you can also keep dharma books around the house and sure people will pick them for quick browse when you are not looking learn bit about other people traditions well browsing through books they owned ,1
different times different cultures same point they were trying get across jesus said god has beginning nor end buddha said mind was never born and has never died just replace the word meditation with prayer and couting the breath with the name jesus and everyone happy,1

 always liked vecna the one time was able use him story had blast playing the fact that was far not the most powerful deity but was one the most dangerous due his portfolio but favorite pale night who technically not deity but close enough guess most the abyssal lords and the rulers the nine hells are fairly straightforward and have ample backstory but her lack thereof just intriguing ,1
though don have any good suggestions for additional deities the moment you should probably have some overlap the cavern dwelling gnolls might consider pelor the god evil blinding them with his wicked light loki has sufficiently fooled them over the years into thinking their benefactor always leading them the bountiful crops they steal from the peasantry they have statues him fat woman giving out food the starving they view the god death the god justice giving righteous end those gnolls that have served brutal conflicts point view can change everything ,-1
 cliche but you can wrong with cyric mean was mortal who just nabbed all when got the chance you gotta respect that ,-1
zon kuthon and his sister shelyn good deity have really cool story from the pathfinder setting plus off topic pathfinder has the coolest good deity ever cayden cailean was bard that got wasted one night stumbled into the temple the star stone artifact that can turn you into deity and woke the next morning with hangover memory the night before and godly powers ,1
 homebrew setting the primary lawful evil deity named for friend lewie essentially has three domains tyranny law applied without mercy vengeance and community the idea being that cruel and harsh god but also recognizes that you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar thus his church often the most benevolent toward the common people day day basis the running gag that lewian churches sponsor more inner city basketball teams than any other major faith you probably want change the name but might make interesting dynamic within your setting ,-1

 like the idea prometheus giving magic the pcs however think that prometheus should more like demi god and that the reason why gives the magic mortals prometheus could jealous the fact that the gods have all the powers and they granted him only half status upon his creation thus his revenge giving humanity order turn the tides power among deities and mortals furthermore perhaps the repercussion prometheus feels from his action being dragged the underworld cerberus making him seem less than deity like and more mortal inhuman order face judgment from egyptian goddess morals virtue and judge the dead ,1

zen master bassui said when the functioning analytical consciousness destroyed feelings are purified this referred the pure land the west you truly want know the meaning being born the pure land you must first know the master who born this land the physical body has never from its inception been the true body but rather temporary formation the five aggregates after the four elements disperse what remains called the self the self originally empty what that born the pure land there master born the pure land what that seeks this land bliss just extinguish the ever seeking mind rid thoughts and attachment form and the body consisting the four elements will have individual self when there individual mind the nature mind and there aspect disorder ,1
pure land other power opposed the usual self power taught most buddhist schools though the pure land here and now and not some other dimension the afterlife ,1
there are many flavours buddhism pure land ideas are not common all them however the important thing realize doesn really matter that the big difference compared the abrahamic religions buddhism not dogmatic the sense bunch things that must taken literally else you are non believer sinner whatever maybe pure land ideas work for you great maybe they don great what works for you works for you what doesn work useless you the historical buddha himself taught dramatically different styles suit his audience parables and metaphors are just that the point where they take you not literally believing them literally and physically true zen koans are good example this very purely distilled most are the form stories but not stories you are believe physically happened you are reading history book that entirely irrelevant what the story does you that the point you are wondering did this really happen does this place really exist you are missing that point also worth noting that most things are about psychological phenomenon not physical phenomenon personally find this makes buddhist cosmology much easier understand than considering competitor physical cosmology they not conflict they just about different cosmos ,1
going try comment this simply can gets metaphysical and some may even say supernatural but hope you can try maintain open mind enough for help with your understanding everything that physical everything that exists the universe and beyond are created the power the mind exercised through consciousness mara created the samsara worlds planes dimensions that may experience joy sadness love heartbreaks etc this was done through his her its focus the mind and streams consciousness began attracted these worlds planes dimensions and begin develop craving for existence and thus begins the cycle rebirth the pure lands buddhism were created the focus the mind amitabha buddha way help individuals attain enlightenment their own pace amitabha buddha understood that the attraction emotions sex love and existence can overwhelming for normal individuals overcome within one lifetime 100 years average for human beings other beings much shorter and yet others much longer created the pure lands the west place refuge and practice for those who call upon his name sincerely this place not metaphorical state mind while these individuals are earth for lack better word real though not necessarily physical the way feel physical things via the electromagnetic repelling force electrons this world certain laws physics are applicable that world land plane dimension whatchamacallit certain laws physics not apply and yet newer laws superphysics would also the rule there that not the law our world now having been carried this land doesn mean that the individuals are guaranteed enlightenment first they still need cultivate themselves while there enlightenment not given dependant every single individual consciousness efforts shed the fetters samsara anger ignorance and jealousy and embrace the noble truths they may choose rejoin the samsaric worlds again and back into the cycle rebirth but least they have the option stay and cultivate themselves the pure land the west that would the main difference between the abrahamic idea heaven against the amitabha buddha pure lands the west hope this helps,1
think your characterization pure land isn that far off there reason not that popular among westerners odd abandon christianity judaism and take pure land because first impressions buddhism was that was devoid dogma but now seems much leap faith the abrahamic religions least the pure land sect most forms buddhism have some sort supernatural element some orthodox believers might deny that just like some christians might attempt make scientific arguments for the world being 6000 years old the very least you have rebirth and different planes that includes devas zen seems have the least reverence for dogma which why popular the west the other western strategy assume things are meaningful figuratively and not literally but yeah buddhism religion the end the day for most its followers,1
most religions have dogmatic orthodox well esoteric philosophic side the christian heaven can seen palace the clouds state mind rebirth buddhism can seen fact just superstition left over from other beliefs you interpret and understand you see fit like think about various religions talking about the same thing using different words and yes cherry pick what believe but honestly and very carefully think better than taking everything religion says and rejecting everything doesn say there must hundred different ways talk about enlightenment heaven pure land individuation alchemy rites passage education trials meditation the tricky part that what describes can easily explained words and most importantly has understood which different than just knowing reading about the pure land real place state mind doubt real place but sure some will believe buddhism has some dogma but not nearly much eastern religions ,1
you won find one answer your question but the pure land state mind perspective reality not separate place let quote thich nhat hanh human beings our deepest desire find environment which secure and where there love and understanding all want live such environment you live surroundings where you feel there security understanding and love and where people have the capacity transform their suffering fear and attachment then you live the pure land from finding our true home this isn leap faith all because you have already been the pure land but momentarily every time you bring the buddha mind fully then you are said the pure land imagine because you enter that state some degree this not matter faith but expanding upon what you know joyful experience quite different the abrahamic religions concept heaven which eschatological reality rather than gnostic one will add that there course are some who believe the pure land totally separate paradise however there are positive ways understanding this when the state mind another rebirth will seem like such foreign reality that may well different place entirely ,1
 first impressions buddhism was that was devoid dogma isn good thing about buddhism least for outsider that much easier pick and choose what parts you not want use see dogma kind environment habitat for the profound and useful ideas develop all religions have something useful buddhist religions and not just one homogeneous buddhism just seem have something that more relevant and powerful the context our culture ,1
from limited knowledge the pure land not paradise but place contemplation stepping off point where you are given the knowledge leave the cycle suffering and rebirth anything more akin the now defunct catholic idea purgatory than actual heaven ,1
response your question about how amitabha created the pure land this quote from the article pure land buddhism wikipedia the longer sukhāvatīvyūha sūtra the buddha begins describing his attendant ānanda past life the buddha amitābha states that past life amitābha was once king who renounced his kingdom and became bodhisattva monk named dharmākara dharma storehouse under the guidance the buddha lokeśvararāja world sovereign king innumerable buddha lands throughout the ten directions were revealed him after meditating for five eons bodhisattva then made great series vows save all sentient beings and through his great merit created the realm sukhāvatī ultimate bliss this land sukhāvatī would later come known the pure land chinese translation important remember that buddhism has been around for thousands years and that for long time buddhists didn have telescopes big machines scan the brain with his holiness the dalai lama himself has said that the discoveries science and the teachings buddhism contradict then the discoveries science are correct this video tgv1gwvrz one the major teachings the buddha was test out each his teachings oneself order see they were true rather than taking his word faith without proof however course just man who has seen mountain some remote region where one has not traveled may believed until the distance that region crossed might have some sort faith buddhist teachings since the people doing the teachings have often devoted their whole lives the teachings the buddha,1

the discussion about the rat ended concluding won work because you will naturally headbutt the rat death minotaur might work with another race though trog wrath very very very difficult survive you have boots levitation and lots food you might able hover over lava deep water won help summons giant sized creatures other than that tomb card might work you have your stash food not sure you not using shield you might well switch two handed axe from experience anti magic isn that great with brand fire you can generally kill things faster use holy versus liches and other undead casters and also kill them faster ,1
 could swear they lowered trog wrath just got extremely lucky because recently tried make the switch kobe and was not difficult all just took food ring and some perma food and carved out two space area near the the summons were actually not the worst part the worst got was berserk hill giant and the vast majority were just berserk bears for the worst part was actually the rotting since happened least times and never caught right away while spamming rest,-1
for the love gods don the abyss until trog wrath over none your teleport blink panic buttons work lost handful very promising mibes this way ,1
 when and how supposed swap tso and branch order from there basically you switch immediately before entering crypt clear crypt max tso piety then holy brand your best weapon your case that executioners axe and off you post endgame branch order like whatever theres strict order like there the early game whichever branch you feel best prepared for how avoid meeting terrible fate the hands trog wrath you have book with blink soon you leave trog train transloc little bit that you can cast then whenever surrounds you with berserking enemies you can blink out the middle them and run staircase teleport you can keep scrolls blinking hand for this purpose but feel more secure also having the spell trog wrath includes fire miscasts that burn all your shit see trick with going lair and having rat block you off but this still viable you can the rat shield thing with most combos but its tedious and unnecessary and your case the minotaur retaliatory headbutt would kill the rat anyway its not option antimagic axe that carry around viable for use all since strictly one handed should train shields use with since have shield reflection could use not really war axes arent very good and while has fantastic selection resists does little damage that its not practical choice weapon against any tough monster wouldnt forgo the damage output weapon use physical shield shields arent very good for melee allruners and therse always tsos divine shield ability you want reflection isnt good shield brand plus its double not good for tso worshiper you reflect poison projectile and hits something you will incur penance for use poison ,1
 brother trog very wrathful indeed but his will destroy you neither endless nor inevitable going take the route many will find the easy way out and say that getting past trog your level trivial his wrath dangerous out the open but when you are able choose the area diluted mere timesink what you must grab your closest disintegration wand and cut two diagnols into the wall this will allow you only view one other tile time this point you simply need make sure you have good chunks permafood pip two and then either drop your scrolls wear conservation that point you just spam rest and then tab every time trog has tantrum minotaur your power should have trouble killing his summons after long while you will get message saying has calmed down then you are free worship that damned tso trog wrath your level probably one the least dangerous things you can spend your time dealing with you are willing cheese ,1
 were you slime zot except for the orb chamber and blade hopefully you find some better armour you really want good executioner axe before you convert well the okay but could better you really need wearing plate gda something heavier you have more than abandoned trog with level mibe and found pretty trivial the berserked stone giants weren terribly difficult and cleared tomb and most all hells while under trog wrath but somewhat wary trying this with your low and weak weapon you could try waiting out but takes thousands and thousands turns very boring one handed axes suck use executioner axe ,1
 have currently rune mibe right now and abandoned trog then immediately cleared crypt max piety and enchant executioner axe then threw caution the winds and cleared pan and hells while under trog wrath was tricky but doable make sure you have curing potions that time was strong enough take out trog summons all sides problem worked but could have died with worse luck ,1
 your stage you should strong enough take the berserk summons have the resources escape out them retreat corridor and take them one one quaff curing heal rot would also recommend you get plate armour better asap for the and guaranteed damage reduction also wield the biggest axes you can find kill things faster ,1
 you max armour dodging and shields for tso divine shield then the berserkers are joke can wipe them even when fully surrounded and only lose health even with armour and dodging they won give you much trouble ,-1
ewwww why are you using broad axe get real weapon bet trog gave you good battleaxe exec axe something splint get plate armour better trog wrath will completely destroy char with such poor defenses ,1
